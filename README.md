# Canadian Immigration

A data-driven analysis of international student disengagement in Canada, exploring immigration trends, economic barriers, and policy implications using machine learning and data visualization techniques.

---

#Project Overview

It is a comprehensive research project that analyzes the systemic challenges faced by international students in Canada. Using immigration and visa data from 2000 to 2023, this study focuses on the nearly 50,000 students who failed to report to their designated institutions during the Spring 2024 term. Through data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling, the project identifies critical issues such as visa delays, financial hardship, housing shortages, and work permit restrictions.
